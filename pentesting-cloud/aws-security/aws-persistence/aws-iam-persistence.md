## IAM

For more information access:

{% content-ref url="../aws-services/aws-iam-enum.md" %}
[aws-iam-enum.md](../aws-services/aws-iam-enum.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Common IAM Persistence

* Create a user
* Add a controlled user to a privileged group
* Create access keys (of the new user or of all users)
* Grant extra permissions to controlled users/groups (attached policies or inline policies)
* Disable MFA / Add you own MFA device
* Create a Role Chain Juggling situation (more on this below in STS persistence)

### Backdoor Role Trust Policies

You could backdoor a trust policy to be able to assume it for an external resource controlled by you (or to everyone):

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                    "*",
                    "arn:aws:iam::123213123123:root"
                ]
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Backdoor Policy Version

Give Administrator permissions to a policy in not its last version (the last version should looks legit), then assign that version of the policy to a controlled user/group.

### Backdoor / Create Identity Provider

If the account is already trusting a common identity provider (such as Github) the conditions of the trust could be increased so the attacker can abuse them.
