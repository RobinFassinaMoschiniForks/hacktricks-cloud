## ECS

For more information check:

{% endcontent-ref %}

### Host IAM Roles

In ECS an **IAM role can be assigned to the task** running inside the container. **If** the task is run inside an **EC2** instance, the **EC2 instance** will have **another IAM** role attached to it.\
Which means that if you manage to **compromise** an ECS instance you can potentially **obtain the IAM role associated to the ECR and to the EC2 instance**. For more info about how to get those credentials check:

### Privesc to node to steal other containers creds & secrets

But moreover, EC2 uses docker to run ECs tasks, so if you can escape to the node or **access the docker socket**, you can **check** which **other containers** are being run, and even **get inside of them** and **steal their IAM roles** attached.

#### Making containers run in current host

Furthermore, the **EC2 instance role** will usually have enough **permissions** to **update the container instance state** of the EC2 instances being used as nodes inside the cluster. An attacker could modify the **state of an instance to DRAINING**, then ECS will **remove all the tasks from it** and the ones being run as **REPLICA** will be **run in a different instance,** potentially inside the **attackers instance** so he can **steal their IAM roles** and potential sensitive info from inside the container.

```bash
aws ecs update-container-instances-state \
    --cluster <cluster> --status DRAINING --container-instances <container-instance-id>
```

The same technique can be done by **deregistering the EC2 instance from the cluster**. This is potentially less stealthy but it will **force the tasks to be run in other instances:**

```bash
aws ecs deregister-container-instance \
    --cluster <cluster> --container-instance <container-instance-id> --force
```

A final technique to force the re-execution of tasks is by indicating ECS that the **task or container was stopped**. There are 3 potential APIs to do this:

```bash
# Needs: ecs:SubmitTaskStateChange
aws ecs submit-task-state-change --cluster <value> \
    --status STOPPED --reason "anything" --containers [...]

# Needs: ecs:SubmitContainerStateChange
aws ecs submit-container-state-change ...

# Needs: ecs:SubmitAttachmentStateChanges
aws ecs submit-attachment-state-changes ...
```

### Steal sensitive info from ECR containers

The EC2 instance will probably also have the permission `ecr:GetAuthorizationToken` allowing it to **download images** (you could search for sensitive info in them).
